/**
 * Program Description
 * 1) include variables for integer number, string for playAgain, and a boolean isPrime
 * 2) creates a do while that includes that the number inputted by the user has to be greater than 2.
 * 3) if the nmber is prime it would tell the user that the number inputted was prime, and if not it would say the same but that the number is not prime
 * 4) it would then ask whether the user wants to enter another number by typing in yes to continue or no to stop
 * 5) at the bottom, already explained, it shows that it determines whether it is prime if it is divisible rather than itself and 1.
